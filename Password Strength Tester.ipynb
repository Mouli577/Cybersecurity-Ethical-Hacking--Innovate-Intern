A strong password is essential to prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks such as brute force attacks, phishing, or password cracking.\n","\n","To ensure robustness, a password should satisfy the following criteria:\n","\n","1. It contains at least one lowercase English character.\n","\n","\n","2. It contains at least one uppercase English character.\n","\n","\n","3. It contains at least one special character from the set: !@#$%^&*()-+.\n","\n","\n","4. Its length is at least 8 characters.\n","\n","\n","5. It contains at least one digit.\n","\n","\n","\n","However, relying solely on these criteria might not guarantee complete security. To make passwords even stronger, users can adopt additional practices such as:\n","\n","Increasing Password Length: Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack. Aim for a minimum of 12-16 characters.\n","\n","Avoiding Common Patterns: Avoid dictionary words, sequences like 12345 or password, and easily guessable phrases.\n","\n","Using a Passphrase: Combine unrelated words into a memorable but unique phrase, like \"Sky7@Ocean!Tree.\"\n","\n","Avoiding Reuse: Never reuse passwords across multiple platforms. Each account should have a unique password.\n","\n","Incorporating Unpredictability: Randomly mix characters, numbers, and symbols without relying on predictable patterns.\n","\n","\n","For even higher security, users can leverage multi-factor authentication (MFA) in conjunction with strong passwords and consider using password managers to generate and store complex passwords securely."],"metadata":{"id":"denDP-trYjrJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Python3 program to check if a given\n","# password is strong or not.\n","def printStrongNess(input_string):\n","\n","    n = len(input_string)\n","\n","    # Checking lower alphabet in string\n","    hasUpper = False\n","    hasLower = False\n","    hasDigit = False\n","    specialChar = False\n","    normalChars = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstu\"\n","    \"vwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890 \"\n","    for i in range(n):\n","        if input_string[i].isupper():\n","            hasUpper = True\n","        if input_string[i].islower():\n","            hasLower = True\n","        if input_string[i].isdigit():\n","            hasDigit = True\n","        if input_string[i] not in normalChars:\n","            specialChar = True\n","            # Strength of password\n","    print(\"Strength of password:-\", end = \"\")\n","    if (hasUpper and hasLower and\n","        hasDigit and specialChar and n >= 8):\n","        print(\"Password Is Strong\")\n","    elif ((hasUpper or hasLower) and  # Aligned with the 'if' block\n","          specialChar and n >= 6): # Indentation corrected to match the 'if' block\n","        print(\"Password Is Moderate\")\n","    else:\n","        print(\"Password Is Weak\")\n","\n","# Driver code\n","if __name__==\"__main__\": # Corrected the condition to __name__ == \"__main__\"\n","    input_string = \"Mouli@Ak@132000\"\n","    printStrongNess(input_string)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"moLPEF0EczzB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733312944154,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":492,"user":{"displayName":"Mouli Kayal","userId":"13667706190390066677"}},"outputId":"20aa64cb-a959-4624-c0ff-440f4e8df8d0"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Strength of password:-Password Is Strong\n"]}]}]}
